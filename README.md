# Personal-Site
The site is at www.jaybuch.com

The index.php file is the landing page for the website. This is also called the profile page on the site.

The portfolio.php page has the portoflio pieces that I have worked on during class and will be updated on a regular basis.

The contact.php page is a way for the visitor to contact me either via email, twitter or phone. Please reach out if should you have any questions.

The project does make use of the bootstrap for both CSS and Javascipt and jQuery for Javascript. The bootstrap and jQuery files are in the bootstrap and js folder respectively. 

Any CSS (portfolio.css and portfolio_responsive.css) and Javascript (portfolio.js) scripts written by me are included in the CSS and JS files respectively.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out...

Thanks

Jay
